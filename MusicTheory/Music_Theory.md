## Note

A sound itself, it represents the pitch and duration of a sound in musical notation.

- There are 12 musical notes (In Western Music)
- Natural notes are: C, D, E, F, G, A, B
- Accidental Notes:
  - "#" = Sharps
  - "♭" = Flats
  - Accidental notes are used to fill gaps in music.
    - B♭, F#, G# etc
    - A# (Or any sharp note) is just the same note but 1 fret UP.
    - B♭ (Or any flat note) is just the same note but 1 fret DOWN.

> The Sharp of a note can also be know as the flat (♭) of the note above, e.g., the note between the D and the E is one fret higher than D, which makes it D#, but it's also one fret lower than E, so it could be read as the Eb.

- There are NO notes between B - C and E - F.
  - #: C - C# - D - D# - E - F - F# - G - G# - A - A# - B - C
  - ♭: C - D♭ - D - E♭ - E - F - G♭ - G - A♭ - A - B♭ - B - C

### Note Types: (Based on duration)

- ![alt text](./Images/WholeNote.png) Whole Note: A note that lasts for four beats, or a count of “one, two, three, four”
- ![alt text](./Images/HalfNote.png) Half Note: A note that lasts for two beats
- ![alt text](./Images/QuarterNote.png) Quarter Note: A note that lasts for one beat
- ![alt text](./Images/EighthNote.png) Eighth Note: An eighth note is normally a half beat, so a dotted eighth note becomes three-quarters of a beat long. e.g., One and, Two and
  - When two eighth notes are together, this symbol ![alt text](./Images/EighthNotesConnected.png) is used
- Sixteenth Note: A note that lasts for a quarter of a beat
- ![alt text](./Images/DottedHalfNote.png) Dotted Half Note: When there is a dot behind a note, it adds half of the note’s length to the note. A half note is normally two beats, so a dotted half note becomes three beats long.
  - Eighth Note is normally a half beat, so a dotted eighth note ![alt text](./Images/DottedEighthNote.png) becomes three-quarters of a beat long.
- Staccato Notes: A style of playing where notes are short and clearly defined. Play the note, remove the pressure from your finger but keep the finger on string.
- Legato Notes: A style of playing where notes are smooth and connected to one another.
- Root note: The first note of a chord – e.g., the root note of A minor is A

## Chord

## Interval

The distance between the pitch of two `notes`, or simply gaps (or distance or space or steps) between two notes:

- Pitch is basically a frequency of note. Higher the frequency, higher the note will be. Lower the frequency, lower the note will be.
- Two types of Intervals:
  - Half-Step = One Fret = Half-tone or Semitone
  - Whole-Step = Two Fret = Whole-Tone
- Intervals are the building blocks of Music.
- Harmonic intervals are the building blocks of Chords.
  - Any two notes played together are called harmonic intervals.
Melodic intervals are the building blocks of Scales.
- In melody one note is played at a time.
- Melodies are usually played on higher strings.
Starting note of an interval is called **root-note**. And then:
  - Unison
  - minor 2nd
  - Major 2nd
  - minor 3rd
  - Major 3rd
  - Augmented 4th / Diminished 5th / Tritone
  - Perfect 5th
  - minor 6th
  - Major 6th
  - minor 7th
  - Major 7th
  - Octave
- Intervals are named with a number and quality such as:
  - Number: How many note letters the interval covers
  - Quality: Describes the sound of interval
    - minor
    - Major
    - Perfect
    - Augmented
    - Diminished
- Octave: An interval of 8 notes of a musical scale that shares notes of the same name – e.g. from a low C to a high C.

### Major Scale Chord Progression

- Make a Major Scale
- Convert Note names to Chord names:
  - a M m m M M m D Arrange a few chords from a key
- Pick a strumming pattern
- Experiment, Play Around

- Chord Progression

| - | Major | minor | minor | Major | Major | minor | Diminished |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| - | I | ii | iii | IV | V | VI | vii° |
| Key of C | C | Dm | Em | F | G | Am | B° |
| Key of D | D | Em | F#m | G | A | Bm | C#° |
| Key of E | E | F#m | G#m | A | B | C#m | D#° |
| Key of F | F | Gm | Am | B♭ | C | Dm | E° |
| Key of G | G | Am | Bm | C | D | Em | F#° |
| Key of A | A | Bm | C#m | D | E | F#m | G#° |

## Keys

The group of pitches (the scale) that is used in a song.

![alt text](./Images/piano.png)

- **Major Key:** There are only 7 notes (Out of 12 notes) in a Major Key.
  - Formula for Major Scale is: W-W-H-W-W-W-H (That's a spacing between the notes)
  - Cmaj Scale would be: C D E F G A B C
  - Amaj Scale would be: A B C# D E F# G# A
  - In Major Scales, letter names appear only once, no matter how many accidentals there are
  - A# Maj Scale would be: B♭ C D E♭ F G A B♭
- **Minor Key:** Same goes for Minor Key as well. Only 7 Notes
- **Relative keys:** Keys that share the same notes but start on different notes – e.g., C major and A minor contain the same notes, but C major starts on C while A minor starts on A

## Scales

Organized sequences of notes played in an ascending or descending order. The distance, or interval, between notes in a scale determines its sound and character.

- Chromatic scale: A scale including all 12 notes
- Pentatonic scale: A scale containing only 5 unique notes
- Major scale:
- Minor scale:

## Triads

A triad is a three-note chord built by stacking two thirds: root, third, and fifth. What “stacking two thirds” means:

- A triad has three distinct notes named by *consecutive* letter names (e.g., C–E–G), where:
  - Root → Third is a third (major or minor)
  - Third → Fifth is a third (major or minor)

### Major vs. Minor triads

- **Major triad:** root + major third + perfect fifth.
  - Semitone formula: `0–4–7`
  - Stack: Major third, then minor third (M3 + m3)
  - Sound: bright/stable
  - Example: C–E–G, D–F#–A

- **Minor triad:** root + minor third + perfect fifth.
  - Semitone formula: `0–3–7`
  - Stack: Minor third, then major third (m3 + M3)
  - Sound: darker/more somber
  - Example: C–E♭–G, D–F–A

The four triad qualities (all fit the definition):

- Major: `0–4–7` (M3 + m3), e.g., C–E–G
- Minor: `0–3–7` (m3 + M3), e.g., C–E♭–G
- Diminished: `0–3–6` (m3 + m3), e.g., C–E♭–G♭
- Augmented: `0–4–8` (M3 + M3), e.g., C–E–G#

Not triads (because they’re not stacked thirds):

- Sus2 (C–D–G) and Sus4 (C–F–G) replace the third, so they’re “suspended” chords, not triads.
- Power chords (C–G) are dyads, not triads.

List of common Major Triads in enharmonic equivalents (same pitches, different spellings) are:

```bash
 - C: C – E – G
 - G: G – B – D
 - D: D – F# – A
 - A: A – C# – E
 - E: E – G# – B
 - B (C♭): B – D# – F# | C♭ – E♭ – G♭
 - F# (G♭): F# – A# – C# | G♭ – B♭ – D♭
 - C# (D♭): C# – E# – G# | D♭ – F – A♭
 - A♭ (G#): A♭ – C – E♭ | G# – B# – D#
 - E♭ (D#): E♭ – G – B♭ | D# – F## – A#
 - B♭ (A#): B♭ – D – F | A# – C## – E#
 - F (E#): F – A – C  | E# – G## – B#
```

> Quick rule of thumb:
>
> - To turn a major triad into minor, lower the third by one semitone, and vice-versa.
> - If the three note names are consecutive letters (like A–C–E or F#–A#–C#) and the inner intervals are thirds (3 or 4 semitones each), it’s a triad.
> - The specific sizes of those thirds determine whether it’s major, minor, diminished, or augmented.

## Misc

- **Pick-up bar:** When one or more beats are skipped at the start of the first measure (the first bar) of a song

## Circle of Fifths

Visually explained [URL](https://cosmic-lotus.itch.io/circle-of-fifth).

Clock-face layout:

![alt text](./Images/circle-of-fifths.png)

Linear (clockwise by fifths →):

C (Am) → G (Em) → D (Bm) → A (F#m) → E (C#m) → B (G#m) → F#/G♭ (D#m/E♭m) → D♭/C# (B♭m/A#m) → A♭ (Fm) → E♭ (Cm) → B♭ (Gm) → F (Dm) → back to C (Am)

Notes:

- Clockwise = add one sharp each step; counterclockwise = add one flat each step.
- Enharmonic pairs (same pitches, different names): F#=Gb, C#=Db, B=Cb, etc.

Quick guitar use:

- In any key, I–IV–V are neighbors: the key (I), one step left is IV, one step right is V. For G major: I=G, IV=C, V=D.

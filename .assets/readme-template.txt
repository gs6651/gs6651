### 🎸 Harmonic Engineering
I approach the guitar through the lens of structural analysis. To me, music theory isn't just art—it's the study of harmonic frequencies, wave patterns, and interval mathematics. I treat the fretboard as a six-stringed coordinate system where I debug sonic architecture through rhythmic patterns and signal resonance.

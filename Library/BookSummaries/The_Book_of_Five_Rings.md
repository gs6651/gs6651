# The Book of Five Rings (Miyamoto Musashi)

1. Earth Ring 🌎

This principle is about brutal self-assessment and honestly tracking your time to understand your current, unproductive state.

- Track everything. Minor & Major Details.
- See the ugly truth.
- Accept everything the way it is, not the way you wish it was.

2. Water Ring 🌊

This principle teaches you to flow around obstacles by starting with small, manageable steps instead of creating a rigid plan and failing.

- Each small wins rewire your identity

3. Fire Ring🔥

This ring is about using anger and jealousy as fuel for self-improvement, converting feelings of being "pathetic" into productive rage to destroy your own weaknesses.
4. Wind Ring 🌬️
This principle focuses on the importance of staying humble and never believing you've "arrived." You should consistently study people who are better than you to fuel your growth.
5. Void Ring 🈳
The final ring teaches that discipline is an "eternal practice" and that you get stronger not by doing easier things, but by doing hard things automatically.

- Discipline is a weapon, and war against the mediocrity never ends. Win it daily.
- When does it get easier? No, Ask this: What's today's battle?

The Power of Atomic Habits:
- A slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. It goes both ways positive or negative. "You are your habits."
- Massive success is not a result of massive steps, but small ones.
- Compound effect is 1% better each day, which results in 37x better in a year.
- Success is the produce of daily habits, not once-in a lifetime transformations.
- Small changes are not noticeable (first stage known as valley of disappointment). To see change, you must stick to something for a while (exponential growth).
- Forget about goals, focus on systems instead. Not on the product, but the process of how you will get there.
- Set specific realistic goals.
- Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.
- Layers of behavior change: Outcomes, Processes, Identity. Most focus on outcomes, but successful people focus on identity or the person (they want to become).

"The Goal is not to learn an instrument, but it is to become a musician."

Law 1: Make it Obvious.
	○ Create a habit scorecard, and label each habit positive, negative, or even.
	○ Unless you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate. - Carl Yung.
	○ Make habits clear (e.g.,  "I will play guitar for 30 minutes daily at 6am in the other bedroom", rather than "I will play guitar this month").
	○ Stack habits. After [current habit], I will [new habit]. (e.g.,  After brush, I'll go for 20 minutes run).
	○ Environment > Motivation. To drink more water, always have a water bottle around. To play Guitar more, always have a guitar nearby. Get bad habits out of sight. One Space, One Use. Have a separate zone for separate things: Eating Zone, Sleeping Zone, Reading Zone, Playing Guitar Zone, Relaxing Zone.
	○ Breaking a bad Habit: Make it invisible. To quit social media, mute the notifications or uninstall the apps. To quit sugar, stop keeping snacks at your home.


Law 2: Make it Attractive.
	○ You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience.
	○ Dopamine is not just linked to pleasure, but also when we anticipate it. Thus, the craving is what causes us to take action in the first place. (e.g.,  Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win).
	○ Use temptation bundling. Link working out with watching a show or listening to music, so you get something you want to do, when you do something you need to do. 
	○ Put yourself in the right environment. To get fit, surround yourself with people who make going to the gym a norm. To be a better musician, find group of people who are musician or trying to become.
	○ Primal Motivators: The source of cravings. Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old vices (faults). The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same.


Law 3: Make it Easy
	○ The more you do something, the easier it becomes over time.
	○ Easy habits are more likely to happen, so stick to an easy habit, and not wanting to wake up at 6 when being used to waking up at 8.
	○ Reduce friction from good habits, increase friction in bad habits. To stop watching TV, unplug it after every use and put the remote in an inconvenient location. Do anything you can to make your Bad habits less likely to occur.
	○ 2-min rule to stop procrastinating. Start small with habits, work out for only 5 min to start with, or only stretch for a bit every day to start. Get the routine anchored in place and then slowly increase the difficulty. Don’t try to do too much too soon.

Law 4: Make it Satisfying
	○ What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.
	○ Good habits don’t feel too good in short term, but feel good in the long run, so add immediate pleasure after doing a good habit.
	○ Have a habit tracker.
	○ Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. So, just show up everyday.
	○ Don’t break the chain of doing a good habit.

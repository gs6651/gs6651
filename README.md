# Hi, I'm Gaurav! 👋

Welcome to my specialized Linux & Networking workspace. I've organized my "Second Brain" into four distinct hubs to streamline my workflow between my office and personal machines.

## 🛠️ The Architecture

### 💻 [Terminal-Center](https://github.com/gs6651/Terminal-Center)
**The Forge.** This is my central command hub. It contains my `system-forge.sh` automation script which I use to provision and optimize fresh Ubuntu and Fedora installations in minutes.

### 📡 [Packet-Foundry](https://github.com/gs6651/Packet-Foundry)
**The Vault.** (Private) My deep-dive repository for networking architecture, packet analysis, and enterprise infrastructure notes.

### 🎸 [Six-String-Sanctuary](https://github.com/gs6651/Six-String-Sanctuary)
**The Journey.** A public log of my guitar progress, music theory studies, and transcriptions.

### 🖋️ [The-Inkwell](https://github.com/gs6651/The-Inkwell)
**The Library.** A curated collection of book summaries, knowledge synthesis, and general learning.

## 🚀 Automation & Sync
I use a custom-built `gitsync` tool (found in Terminal-Center) to keep all four repositories synchronized across my Linux and Windows environments with a single command.

- **OS:** Ubuntu 25.10 / Fedora 43
- **Shell:** Bash Optimized
- **Tools:** VS Code, GNOME, Custom Forge Scripts
